# Please answer the following questions and submit them as part of the solution package when you are done with it. 

## 1. What are you hoping to find in your next position that would make it the right next step in your career? 
```
I'm looking for a position that not only offers technical challenges but also supports my continuous growth as a developer. As a Senior Mobile Developer with a strong React Native background, I'm now eager to expand my full stack skills and contribute to projects end-to-end. I value environments that encourage learning, collaboration, and ownership, and where I can push myself to deliver high-quality, scalable solutions.

## 2. What have you learned so far about LawnStarter that excited you?
```
I'm genuinely excited by LawnStarter's product space and the clear growth potential for both the company and the people who help build it. I appreciate the focus on engineering quality and the opportunity to work in a fast-moving, product-driven environment. It feels like a place where I could make meaningful contributions while continuing to evolve professionally.

## 3. Have you worked in an environment where developers own delivering features all the way to production? We have QA (Quality Assurance) and a Product Operations team, however, they exist to provide support to engineers. Are you comfortable going to a place where the quality buck stops with the engineers and you have the ability to deploy and observe your own code in production? 
```
Yes, I have worked in such environments and still do. I'm a strong advocate for this model. I believe engineers should take full ownership of what they buildâ€”from development to deployment and observability. It fosters responsibility, improves quality, and shortens feedback loops. I feel confident and comfortable in this kind of setup, and I enjoy having that level of accountability and autonomy.

```

## 4. What is the next technology or subject you are hoping to learn about?
```
Speaking of technology, I would say AI and machine learning. I have had the opportunity to work with AI "Phyton" at OpenAI and it was an incredible experience, having the opportunity to train AI models.

As for other subjects, I would choose Cloud. I would study everything I could about it.
